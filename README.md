# roman-to-integer
- A converter that converts roman numerals to numbers, beautified with visuals.
- If you want to use images or icons you should add freepik links and descriptions in your footer or in the visible part of the page
- Currently it can convert up to 3999. If I can find time in the future, I will make it reach higher numbers.
